                <p>Jessica Jones is inseparable from New York, a city that mirrors her toughness and inner struggles.
                    Hell’s Kitchen, with its restless energy, dark corners, and neon lights, isn’t just her backdrop but
                    a reflection of her own resilience. The city shapes her, challenges her, and becomes as much a
                    character in her story as Jessica herself.</p>
