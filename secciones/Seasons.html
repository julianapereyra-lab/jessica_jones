    <h1>Jessica Jones<br>Season 3 (2019)</h1>
    <p>
      In the final season, Jessica faces a new threat: Gregory Sallinger, a brilliant but sadistic serial killer who
      despises powered people. As Jessica hunts him, she clashes with her former best friend Trish Walker, who has
      now gained powers and taken on the role of vigilante “Hellcat.” The season explores their fractured relationship
      as Trish’s desire for justice spirals into vengeance.
